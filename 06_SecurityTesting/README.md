####Installation Instruction
######Prerequisite packages:

Ruby and related Gems
- For Unix:
```sh
curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```
- For Windows: download and install <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> then <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads" targe="_blank">Install DevKit</a> (package is to support Ruby to build native package during gem installation).<br>
You should choose a non-space in full path as the destination for the kit. i.e C:\DevKit, then add *C:\DevKit\bin;C:\DevKit\mingw\bin* to your System PATH (type below command on prompt)
```sh
SET PATH=C:\Devkit\bin;C:\Devkit\mingw\bin;%PATH%
```
- After Ruby is installed, run below commands to install gems
```sh
sudo gem install bundler
bundle install
```

JDK (version >= 1.7): you should grab it from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">Oracle Website</a>
######Checkout project from GitHub and setup the test lab
- We will use Railsgoat app as test lab for this session. This is a Ruby-Rails web app which was designed to demonstrate OWASP Top 10
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SydneyTestersBootcamp/sydneyTestersBootcamp.git
git clone https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat.git
cd railsgoat
bundle install
```
- If you don't have git, you can find it <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>.
- If gem installation finishes successfully (you see no error), you can start the lab as below:
```sh
rake db:setup (to setup a clean DB with some seed data) 
rails server (start up server at port 3000)
```
- You now can access to the lab via http://localhost:3000/
- NOTE: you should now disconnect your computer from network since the Security Test Lab was purposely setup with security holes, hence would leave your PC openned for being attacked
